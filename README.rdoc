= Rackables

A collection of useful Rack middleware, and more

== Middleware

* Rackables::Branch - Conditionally re-routes the Rack stack at runtime to an alternate endpoint
* Rackables::CacheControl - Sets response Cache-Control header
* Rackables::DefaultCharset - Sets charset directive in Content-Type header
* Rackables::Get - Allows creation of simple endpoints and path routing with a syntax similar to Sinatra's get method
* Rackables::HideExceptions - Rescues exceptions with a static exception page
* Rackables::TrailingSlashRedirect - 301 Redirects requests paths with a trailing slash

== More 

Rackables also bundles a Rack environment inquirer similar to Rails.env:
	
  Rack.env                # => "development"
  Rack.env.development?   # => true

== Use

Rackables is hosted as a gem on Gemcutter, so you just need to:

  sudo gem install rackables
  
or if you wish to bundle with an app that uses Bundler, you just need to add this to your Gemfile:

  gem "rackables"

Requiring 'rackables' will add autoloads for all Rackables middlewares. To use the Rack.env inquirer, 
you must explicitly require "rackables/more/env_inquirer".

Example config.ru:

  require 'rackables'
  require 'rackables/more/env_inquirer'
  require 'my_endpont_app'

  if Rack.env.development?
    use Rack::ShowExceptions
  else
    use Rackables::HideExceptions, 'public/500.html'
  end

  use Rackables::TrailingSlashRedirect
  use Rackables::CacheControl, :public, :max_age => 60
  use Rackables::DefaultCharset, 'utf-8'

  use Rackables::Get, '/ping_monitor' do
    "pong"
  end

  use Rackables::Branch do |env|
    Rack::Lobster if env["PATH_INFO"] =~ /^\/lobster$/
  end

  run MyEndpointApp
